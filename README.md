archfai
=======

Archfai stands for Archlinux fully automatic installation. This little project
aims to provide a shell script package specific for archlinux which makes it
possible to automate the complete installation process with just one command.

Usage
=====
# Upload the files in src to a webspace of your choice
# Change the links in initstrap.sh appropriately
# Adjust the settings in env.conf according to your taste
	but be aware of what you change.
# Shorten the link of your new initstrap.sh location
# Start the Archlinux live cd and establish a working internet connection
# Execute the command:
	$ curl -L <shortened_link> | bash

That's all.
You should have a working base installation of Archlinux in about
3 minutes or less (if your internet connection is fast enough).
