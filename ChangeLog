[stable-rc1] - Author: forflo (24.10.2014)
* Splitted env.conf into env.conf and lib.sh. 
    lib.sh now contains all library functions 
    and env.conf only configuration variables
* Refactored initstrap.sh. In online mode initstrap.sh
    does not download the files to disk anymore
    The eval "$(curl -L >link<)" approach is used, which
    is not only faster but more clean than the previous
    code. 
    
    Attention! You, and _only_ you, are obliged to
    take care of secure transfer of the evaluated code!
* Little bugfixes (see. Issues)

[beta-rc2] - Author: forflo (24.10.2014)
* First publicly usable release
